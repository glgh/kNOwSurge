# kNOwSurge
It's 8:15, raining. I want to take a uber to work, but it's surging. 2.2x! No, no way! The price may drop soon, but who knows? Now is the time to leave - if I still want to catch the bus and get in before 9...but it's raining...but it's 2.2x surging...but I won't have much choice if I keep waiting... if only...if only I kNOwSurge better.
